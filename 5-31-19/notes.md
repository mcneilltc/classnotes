** more java**
generalized--to -- specialized

derived classes--- uses the extends keyword, java only supprots single base classes only. Constructor must call base constructor.
Uses the super keyword. Inherit all public members from base class. cannot access private member of base class

changing behavior @override -- deirved calsses can re-implement inherited methods, allows certain ones to be different

abstract base classes-- prevents a clss from being directly instantiated, uses the word abstract in the declaration. 
abstract method-- can be part of the abstrat class, signature defined but no method body, method must be overriden in derived class

polymorphism-- primary reason for designing heirarchies. -the proper method is determined at the runtime

interfaces-- specifies methods that must be defined by implementing class.-- the methods have no body, signatures only
naming conventions for interfaces-- capital I "I" commonly end in -able Comparable, Serializable, Iserializable, Icomparable...
