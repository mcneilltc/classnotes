# What I learned working on the book shelf project #

Working on the bookshelf project was a very interesting ordeal. Working as part of a team to acheive the same goal was fun. We were able to bring together the ideas of **four** different people was a very valuable learning experience. Also within this group dynamic we tried to play to each others strengths in order to get the project done in a timely maner. 

# What I did well #

What I think I did well, was being able to get the **Bootstrap** to work properly with the applications code. I do think that I was able to get an overall understanding of all the pieces and parts of the application that we created. 

### **Example:** ###
``` javascript
<div className='Component-Bg'>
    <div className="other">
       <div className="shelf">
        </div>
    </div>
</div>                        
```
I think that I also did well not messing up the code. And I also improved upon my use of gitHub.

# What I can improve on #

There are a lot of things that I could improve upon:  
* my understanding of promises
* getting a better understanding of the react environment
* improving javascript skills and knowlegde
* asking for more help when I don't understand somethings
* helping others to understand a concept when I can

If we had more time for the project I would hope to be able to incorporate more user friendly ideas, like a custom google search option, seperate bookshelves for genres of books or being able to save book additions.

# Other thoughts #

I liked working in the group  for the project . There were some times when I felt like I wasn't contributing enough because a few group members were better at a particular aspect of project than I was. But as a gained an understanding of what was going on, I asked to be able to add a few aspects to check my understanding. I also think that other teams members took it upon themselves to try and do everything and that they worked better alone versus with a group. I'm not sure I was able to gain anything from this particular interaction. There wasn't a real clear leader role in the group but it was inherent based on the top coder in the group.e
